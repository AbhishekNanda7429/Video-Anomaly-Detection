# Video-Anomaly-Detection
Detecting anomaly using AlexNet,VGG16,MxNet

UCSD DATASET: http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.html

The first model AlexNet is trained on UCSD dataset which is downloaded from the above link.
<br>
Step1: import all the required libraries.
</br>
<br>
Step2: set the train folder dataset and test folder dataset.
</br>
<br>
Step3: proceed acoording to the ipynb shells.
</br>
<br>
Step4: set the parameters for the model.
</br>
<br>
Step5: compile the model and save it using callback functions.
</br>
<br>
Step6: train the model and use the matplot library to plot the accuracy and loss.
</br>
<br>
NOTE: the same procedure goes for VGG16 too.
</br>
<br>
The third model is MxNet, it is different from others because it is an autoencoder.
</br>
<br>
Step1: first import the libraries including mxnet. if you dont have mxnet then use "!pip install mxnet" .
</br>
<br>
Step2: here the dataset we are using is imported from the kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/bladerunnerrachel/ucsd-anomaly-dataset
</br>
<br>
Step3: after importing follow the procedure in shells.
</br>
<br>
Step4: train the model and save the model.
</br>
<br>
Step5: use matplot library to plot the anomaly in frames. it will show frame-wise where the anomaly is present using a red dot on it.
</br>
<br>
All the steps mentioned above are in brief so kindly use your brain if you have any doubts!!
